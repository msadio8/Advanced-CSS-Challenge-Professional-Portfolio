                                A self-motivated Web Developer student in Sydney University
                                bootcamp 2023, I am passionate to learn new skillset in coding and become a full stack
                                web
                                developer in the near future . I am adaptable, resilient, and enthusiastic with good
                                attention to detail. My
                                passion for working with people also inspires me to take on new challenges that will
                                help to achieve my career goals. I enjoy working in a team, helping others along their
                                journey and has a positive outlook of life.

                                I chose to attend the program because I was looking to change my career, and hoping to
                                work in the tech industry. It is a challenging 24-week program, but it's definitely
                                worth it. It's a very rewarding industry with lots of potential, now I will always have
                                a goal to work toward and enjoy what I do for a living.
